Probably knowing that I made a fool of myself talking about us, loving the  Usâ€ there was. Or maybe it was being at lunch with all my friends dreading the moment he would come sit down but then. . . He didn't come.

    "quotes": "Once the trust is broken in a relationship, it is so hard to try to trust again and you may be hurt.\n I was with a guy (a jerk) and I realized he has a longer relationship at the same timeâ€¦ After some months I forget him and it happened again.\n  A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave.\n A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual masterâ€¦â€\n It is time to move onâ€¦ Everything happens for a reason and I know I DO deserve a better man!"

I tell you I still love you.. And I feel stupid. Yes, I know I'm not very smart, I feel stupid a lot, but this is a different kind of stupid. It's the kind where you love someone with all your heart.. And they have completely moved on. Where does that leave me? I can't concentrate on anything.. After a few minutes my mind wanders off.. And I start day dreaming. I re- play all of our memories in my mind, from the first time we met.. The first time we talked.. The first time we hung out.. The first time we hugged.. The first time we held handsâ€¦ Our first kissâ€¦ Our last kiss.. All the times you made me laugh.. It was the best time of my life. No guy ever made me feel the way you made me feel..

    "quotes": "So many of your posts show pain about break- ups. I have studied a great deal on the subject.Here is what I know; hope it helps:\n Women who had a hard time growing up (abuse or other) have trouble establishing and/or dating relationships.\n The best cure for this is to develop a solid career. Confidence and security are equalizers.\n It takes men longer to establish strong feelings of attachment. So, you can't show you've given your heart totally until your sure he is invested.\n Finally, men don't take care of themselves as well as women do. Therefore, they work themselves harder and invest themselves in activities and relationships on a level beyond that of a woman's. This all means, they have little free time and if they are going to give you some, it's because they are very impressed with you. But this is a fickle friend and if your time is not as precious as theirs, they don't cherish your time together.\n Didn't say I could solve your problems but I hope this makes you feel a little better. Basically, just being yourself (a woman) does not guarantee your knowing the inner workings of men and their approach to intimacy.\n Good- luck!"

    "quotes": "When you watch others fall in love and break up, you can't help but say  get over itâ€ but when it happens to you, it's a different story. Take your time and in time she/he will be off your mind. First she/he is on your mind every day and for a long time, then after you barely think about him/her. It's a process. You don't become good at something over night, it's the same with a break up. We're all emotional, it's in our nature. No one on this planet can have a break up and be normal the next day, no matter how many times its happened to you.\n For the older generation that have been in many break- ups, it's a bit different you get over them in a shorter period but we're all emotional wreck. But believe me searching answers won't help, seek answer within yourself. Repair your heart but in a slow and steady pace. Teach yourself to stop thinking about what he/she is doing, thinking or if there's a chance you'll get back together. One last thing. Don't relate it to movies, not many relationships break up and get back together. Just ask yourself, how many of your friends got back together with their ex's?"

You build up all these defenses. You build up a whole armor, for years, so nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid lifeâ€¦ You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like â€˜maybe we should be just friends' or â€˜how very perceptive' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul- hurt, a body- hurt, a real gets- inside- you- and- rips- you- apart pain. Nothing should be able to do that. Especially not love. I hate love.\n  Neil Gaiman"

I'm not rich, I work in the average jobs that pay ok. However not one of them when they left me said that I was ugly, dumb, or a cheater. They always said its because you need to find a career and make money.\n Whats the moral of the story? Find out what is needed and wanted from the beginning. So before you get involved you will know what that person wants and know if you can provide it. Do they want money, looks, what? Then when you know if you can do it or not, join them, or don't. This way your life will be much easier.\n All relationships don't get passed that first crucial step, discover whats needed and wanted by them and them to you."

Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.â€ Franklin P.

    "quotes": "I've liked a person for five and a half years but he doesn't like me. We're best friends so it's kinda hard. Here are some quotes that have helped me out:\n Never regret what you do because at one time it was exactly what you wanted.\n If you like him tell him, cuz tomorrow he could be going out with your best friend.\n If you like a person, and you tell themâ€¦ They hate you afterwardsâ€¦ If you like a person, and don't tell them, you find out they liked you, and now you lost your chance, and they wonder why I am so confused.\n The truth is; we hide so we can be found, we walk away to see who will follow, we cry to see who will wipe away our tears and we let our hearts get broken to see who will come and fix it.\n Forget regret or life is yours to miss, forget loneliness or you'll never get your first kiss.\n Many things in life will catch your eye, few will catch your heart. Pursue those!!\n I'll always be beside you until the very end, wiping all your tears away, being your best friend. I'll smile when you smile and feel all the pain you do, and if you cry a single tear I promise you I'll cry too.\n The worst pain is when someone you know turns into someone you knew.\n A heart is not a play thing a heart is not a toy but if you want it broken just give it to a boy\n In the darkness I sit, absorbing it all in. Letting the pain surge through every inch of my body, Succumbing to it's sting. And I laugh to myself because I truly believed you loved meâ€¦\n Somewhere there's someone who dreams of your smile and finds your presence in life worthwhile so when you are lonely remember it's true somebody somewhere is thinking of you.\n If I could give you one gift, I would give you the ability to see yourself as I see you, so that you could see how truly special you are.\n It's hard to tell your mind to stop loving someone when your heart still does.\n Sometimes the person you really need is the one you didn't think you wanted.\n The hardest part of dreaming about someone you love is having to wake up.\n â€¦ Oh and here's one I made upâ€¦  If You Only Knew How Much I Cared Forever Yours Take My Hand.â€"

Everything in life is a lesson- what you take from what you learned is what is important. If something did or didn't happen, it did or didn't for a reason. The first 3 days of a break up are the hardest- but each day that goes by is easier. Sometimes it takes a heart break to learn what we really need and want in life- and its those who don't stop until they have just that 100% who truly succeed. You may no longer have that person, but you have the lesson, the will power, the knowledge, and the reason to find someone THAT MUCH BETTER!\n You will always survive- and if all else failsâ€¦call a friend, they'll understand and ask them to help you stay away from him, that's what we are here for."
